# MatchCut

## Overview
The Company-Candidate Matching Algorithm is a project that aims to efficiently match companies with candidates based on their preferences. The algorithm takes into account the preferences of both companies and candidates and creates optimal pairings while maximizing cost savings for companies.

## Features
- **Efficient Matching**: The algorithm utilizes a sophisticated matching mechanism to pair companies with candidates, considering their preferences and optimizing the overall matching process.
- **Cost Cutting**: By employing intelligent matching techniques, the algorithm helps companies reduce their costs associated with the candidate selection process, resulting in significant cost savings.
- **Traceability and Validation**: The algorithm provides a trace of the matching process, allowing for verification and validation of the results. It ensures that each pairing is valid and adheres to the preferences of both parties.
- **Scalability**: The algorithm is designed to handle large datasets of companies and candidates, enabling efficient matching even with a substantial number of entities involved.

## Usage
1. Ensure the dataset of companies and candidates is provided in the required format.
2. Customize the algorithm's parameters and preferences according to your specific requirements.
3. Execute the algorithm by running the following command: `node matchingAlgorithm.js`
4. Monitor the matching process and review the results generated by the algorithm.
5. Analyze the cost savings achieved through the optimized matching and make informed decisions based on the outcomes.
